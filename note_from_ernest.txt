Please note the inclusion of the folder 'SMS-sdk'
I've made changes in the Boafo/views.py and the Boafo/urls.py
In order to use the sms via the terminal
1. Navigate to the 'Boafo_project/' directory and run 'python manage.py runserver'

2. Open up another terminal window and navigate to the 'SMS-sdk/python-client/' directory and
 run the command `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`(this requires the internet)
 then run 'python main.py terminal django'
3. The first value you type in that terminal is the value for the To: section(this value has been set to 1430.You will receive an Unknown destination message otherwise.) Hit enter
4. The next will be for the From: section. Hit enter Then enter the actual text you want to send
and hit enter. Please wait a few seconds for response from system 
NB:Our SMS transaction structure is as follows:
the customer initially sends a blank text to 1430
the system responds with a list of all available services
the customer then sends a text with the service no and location separated by a space.
The SMS for now just return with the value that was sent by the customer. Still working on it
